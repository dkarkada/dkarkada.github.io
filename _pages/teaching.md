I really enjoy teaching -- I think sharing knowledge is dope. I'm currently the graduate representative of the Physics department's Major Curriculum Committee. Previously, I won the [Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/) from the Physics department, as well as the selective [Teaching Effectiveness Award](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/teaching-effectiveness/) from the university. You can read my essay for this award [here](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/karkada-2022/).

I was a Graduate Student Instructor for [Physics 7A](https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/physics/) in Fall '21, Spring '22, Summer '23, and Summer '24. I've also taught [Physics C10](https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/physics/) and [Physics C21](https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/physics/) several times.
