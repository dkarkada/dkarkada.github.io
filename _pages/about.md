Hi! I'm Dhruva, a third-year physics graduate student at UC Berkeley. I'm interested in theoretical aspects of systems that learn, and I study deep neural networks as an exemplar model of such systems. I'm especially interested the large-learning-rate phenomena associated with feature learning and I hope to understand why deep learning is more sample-efficient than other machine learning techniques (like kernel machines).

Before moving to the bay area, I lived in Texas and studied physics, astronomy, and computer science at UT Austin. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, cooking, playing chess, messing around with synthesizers, making generative art, or thinking about literally anything other than whatever pressing deadline is approaching.
