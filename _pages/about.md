Hi! I'm Dhruva, a fourth-year physics graduate student at UC Berkeley. I'm interested in the learning mechanisms of systems that learn from an external signal, and I study deep neural networks as a scientifically-accessible model of such systems. I'm especially interested the large-learning-rate phenomena associated with feature learning and I hope to understand why deep learning is more sample-efficient than classical machine learning techniques, like kernel machines. In my free time, I enjoy cooking for friends, playing chess, messing around with synthesizers, watercoloring, and going on long walks.
