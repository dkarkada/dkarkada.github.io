The written test was administered via Scilympiad, and since there were so many teams, we made the majority of the written test multiple-choice (to hasten grading). This is no fun for test-takers, but sadly that's the reality of running a large tournament. The coding challenges were provided via a link to a Google Colab file, which contained the instructions and starter code. Competitors were instructed to clone the file into their Google Drive, write the solutions in their cloned copy, and then submit a link to this file.

The written exam (60 possible points) has a pretty nice bell shape, possibly due to the multiple choice.

Some teams did not even attempt to solve them; others submitted solutions with no working code. Out of 88 teams, 34 had nonzero coding subscores.
